# TCC_SDT_Experiments

This repository contains the files used to run experiments for **Invariant recognition memory spaces for real-world objects revealed with signal-detection analysis** by Igor Utochkin (University of Chicago, IL, USA),  Daniil Azarov (Indiana University Bloomington, IN, USA), & Daniil Grigorev (Koç University, Turkiye).

The files that you can find here are:
1. .js and .html files generated automatically by PsychoPy to launch them online via Pavlovia.org;
2. .jpg files - images from:
   - [The “Massive Memory - Object Categories” stimuli set](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/stimuli.html) (Konkle, T., Brady, T. F., Alvarez, G. A. and Oliva, A. (2010). Conceptual distinctiveness supports detailed visual long-term memory for real-world objects. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 139(3), 558-78);
   -  [The Exemplar-State stimuli set](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/stimuli.html) (Brady, T. F., Konkle, T., Alvarez, G.A., and Oliva, A. (2013). Real-world objects are not represented as bound units: Independent forgetting of different object details from visual memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 142(3), 791-808);
4. .xlsx files containing information on how the stimuli were assigned across groups.

Each Experiment has 4 groups: 3 groups of 2-AFC task and 1 group of 4-AFC task. The latter contains a task where you need to pick a target among all 3 foils. In a 2-AFC task, you need to pick identify a target next to a single foil. To counterbalance the 2-AFC task (because there are always two objects from each of the two categories in Experiments 1 & 2, and 2 exemplars in 2 states in Experiment 3) across participants, we used latin square.

To run an experiment for demonstration purposes, you can download it to your local machine and then upload to your own Pavlovia account, or simply clone the repository to your GitLab.
